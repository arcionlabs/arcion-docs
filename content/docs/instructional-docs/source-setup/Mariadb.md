# Source MariaDB Database

## I. Setup Connection Configuration

1. From ```HOME```, navigate to the connection configuration file
    ```BASH
    vi conf/conn/mariadb_src.yaml
    ```

2. Make the necessary changes as follows:
    ```YAML
    type: MARIADB

    host: 127.0.0.1 #Replace 127.0.0.1 with your MariaDB server host
    port: 3306 #Replace 3306 with the port number to connect to your MariaDB server

    username: "replicant" #Replace replicant with your username that connects to your MariaDB server
    password: "Replicant#123" #Replace Replicant#123 with the your user's password

    slave-server-ids: [1]
    max-connections: 30 #Maximum number of connections replicant can open in MariaDB
    ```


## II. Setup Filter Configuration

1. Navigate to the filter configuration file
    ```BASH
    vi filter/mariadb_filter.yaml
    ```

2. In accordance to you replication needs, specify the data which is to be replicated. Use the format of the example explained below:  

    ```yaml
    allow:
      #In this example, data of object type Table in the catalog tpch will be replicated
      catalog: "tpch"
      types: [TABLE]

      #From catalog tpch, only the NATION, ORDERS, and PART tables will be replicated.
      #Note: Unless specified, all tables in the catalog will be replicated
      allow:
        NATION:
        #Within NATION, only the US and AUS columns will be replicated
        allow: ["US, AUS"]

        ORDERS:  
          #Within ORDERS, only the product and service columns will be replicated as long as they meet the condition o_orderkey < 5000
          allow: ["product", "service"]
          conditions: "o_orderkey < 5000"

        PART: #All columns in the table PART will be replicated without any predicates
      ```

      The following is a template of the format you must follow:

      ```YAML
      allow:
        catalog: <your_catalog_name>
        types: <your_object_type>


        allow:
          <your_table_name>:
             allow: ["your_column_name"]
             conditions: "your_condition"

          <your_table_name>:  
             allow: ["your_column_name"]
             conditions: "your_condition"

          <your_table_name>:
            allow: "your_column_name"]
            conditions: "your_condition"         
      ```


## III. Setup Extractor Configuration

In real-time replication, for accurate computation of latency, you must create a heartbeat table in the source MariaDB.

1. Create a heartbeat table in the catalog/schema you are going to replicate with the following DDL
   ```SQL
   CREATE TABLE "<user_database>"."replicate_io_cdc_heartbeat"(
     "timestamp" BIGINT NOT NULL,
     PRIMARY KEY("timestamp"));
   ```

2. Grant ```INSERT```, ```UPDATE```, and ```DELETE``` privileges on the heartbeat table to the user configured for replication

3. Navigate to the extractor configuration file
   ```BASH
   vi conf/src/mariadb.yaml
   ```

4. Under the Realtime Section, make the necessary changes as follows:
    ```YAML
    realtime:
      heartbeat:
        enable: true
        catalog: “tpch” #Replace tpch with your database name
        table-name [20.09.14.3]: replicate_io_cdc_heartbeat #Replace replicate_io_cdc_heartbeat with your heartbeat table's name if applicable
        column-name [20.10.07.9]: timestamp #Replace timestamp with your heartbeat table's column name if applicable
    ```
