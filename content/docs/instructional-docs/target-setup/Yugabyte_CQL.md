## I. Setup Connection Configuration

1. From Replicant's ```Home``` directory, navigate to the sample YugabyteCQL connection configuration file
    ```BASH
    vi conf/conn/memsql.yaml
    ```
2. Make the necessary changes as follows:
    ```YAML
    type: YUGABYTE_CQL

    #You can specify multiple Cassandra nodes using the format below:
    cassandra-nodes:
      node1: #Replace node1 with your node name
        host: 172.17.0.2 #Replace 172.17.0.2 with your node's host
        port: 9042 #Replace 9042 with your node's port
      node2: #Replace node2 with your node name
        host: 172.17.0.3 #Replace 172.17.0.3 with your node's host
        port: 9043 #Replace 9042 with your node's port    
      .
      .
      .
      .

    username: 'replicant' #Replace replicant with your username that connects to your Cassandra server
    password: 'Replicant#123' #Replace Replicant123#  with your user's password

    #read-consistency-level: LOCAL_QUORUM  #Allowed values: ANY, ONE, TWO, THREE, QUORUM, ALL, LOCAL_QUORUM, EACH_QUORUM, SERIAL, LOCAL_SERIAL, LOCAL_ONE
    #write-consistency-level: LOCAL_QUORUM #Allowed values: ANY, ONE, TWO, THREE, QUORUM, ALL, LOCAL_QUORUM, EACH_QUORUM, SERIAL, LOCAL_SERIAL, LOCAL_ONE

    max-connections: 30 #Specify the maximum number of connections replicant can open in YugabyteCQL
    ```

## II. Setup Applier Configuration

1. Navigate to the sample YugabyteCQL applier configuration file
    ```BASH
    vi conf/dst/yugabytecql.yaml
    ```
2. Make the necessary changes as follows:
    ```YAML
    snapshot:
      threads: 16 #Specify the maximum number of threads Replicant should use for writing to the target

      #If bulk-load is used, Replicant will use the native bulk-loading capabilities of the target database
      bulk-load:
        enable: true|false #Set to true if you want to enable bulk loading
        type: FILE|PIPE #Specify the type of bulk loading between FILE and PIPE
        serialize: true|false #Set to true if you want the generated files to be applied in serial/parallel fashion

        #For versions 20.09.14.3 and beyond
        native-load-configs: #Specify the user-provided LOAD configuration string which will be appended to the s3 specific LOAD SQL command
    ```
